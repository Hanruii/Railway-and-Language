# Lifeline to the Nation: Railway Expansion and Language Shift in the British Raj

## Introduction
Cultural assimilation, the process by which a minority group adopts the dominant culture of the majority society, stands as an important aspect of societal evolution. Language, serving as a central emblem of cultural identity, often reflects the dynamics of this assimilation process. While historical episodes of coerced assimilation policies have left enduring scars, the spontaneous assimilation witnessed amidst the currents of globalization and modernization has also reshaped cultural and linguistic landscapes, leading to the spread of dominant languages at the expense of minority ones.

This paper examines how infrastructure development influences the process of cultural assimilation. Specifically, it scrutinizes the influence of railway expansion on language shifts during the colonial era in India. Through digitizing district level census data in 1881 and 1931, this study employs the Difference-in-Differences (DID) method alongside the least-cost path as an instrumental variable. The analysis reveals a significant increase in the proportion of Hindi as the mother tongue in districts newly connected to railways between 1881 and 1931, indicating a significant influence of infrastructure on cultural assimilation.

By measuring trade costs to the top 20 cities across the subcontinent, I demonstrate that trade with the Hindi Belt area serves as a key mechanism behind this effect. Crucially, the evidence showcases that this effect persists irrespective of migration patterns.

Heterogeneous analysis further suggests that smaller districts and those with moderate initial Hindi speaker proportions exhibit more pronounced increases. By identifying the causal relationship between infrastructure development and cultural assimilation, this research provides new evidence on the pivotal role of infrastructure in cultural assimilation and offers insights into the historical evolution of language.
