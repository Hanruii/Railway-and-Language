# Lifeline to the Nation: Railway Expansion and Language Shift in the British Raj

## Introduction
Cultural assimilation, the process by which a minority group adopts the dominant culture of the majority society, stands as an important aspect of societal evolution. Language, serving as a central emblem of cultural identity, often reflects the dynamics of this assimilation process. While historical episodes of coerced assimilation policies have left enduring scars, the spontaneous assimilation witnessed amidst the currents of globalization and modernization has also reshaped cultural and linguistic landscapes, leading to the spread of dominant languages at the expense of minority ones.
